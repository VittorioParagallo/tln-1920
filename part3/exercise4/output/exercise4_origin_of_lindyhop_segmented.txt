in one account it is argued that, in the slang of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a 'lindy' was a young woman.
there exists an unsubstantiated claim that the word "hop" was documented as early as 1913 as a term for swing dancing and was also, apparently, a term used by early texas tommy dancers to describe the basic move for their dance.

in a more influential, but inaccurate account, however, popular legend has it that dancer "shorty" george snowden renamed the breakaway dance as the lindy hop in a dance contest.
in this version, snowden was one of the 24 couples that competed in a negro dance marathon that began on june 17, 1928 at the manhattan casino, a ballroom that was located at 8th avenue and 155th street in harlem.
[3]

during the contest "as he remembers it - snowden decided to do a breakaway, that is, fling his partner out and improvise a few solo steps of his own.
in the midst of the monotony of the marathon, the effect was electric, and even the musicians came to life...fox movietone news arrived to cover the marathon and decided to take a close-up of shorty's feet" and an interviewer then asked him, "what are you doing with your feet?"
snowden, "without stopping, replied 'the lindy'".

[4]a

research has shown that snowden's account of the naming of the lindy hop in the rockland palace (the manhattan casino which was renamed at the time of the marathon) is likely not true because the term 'lindy hop' in connection with the harlem lindy hop was used for the first time in public in september 1928, which is more than two months after snowden and his partner mattie purnell supposedly named the dance in the dance marathon.
the time gap between the dance marathon and the first use of the term in public does not make sense if snowden really named the dance in the dance marathon.
[5]

as there does not exist proper evidence for the naming of the lindy hop, there exists evidence for inventing the lindy hop in the dance marathon in which snowden and purnell participated and devised the basic principle of the lindy hop.

whether snowden intended it or not, lindy hop was associated with charles lindbergh's transatlantic airplane flight, completed in 1927.
"lindy" was the aviator's nickname.

the reporter interviewing snowden apparently tied the name to charles lindbergh to gain publicity and further his story.

while lindbergh's trans-atlantic flight may or may not have inspired the name "lindy hop", the association between the aviator, george snowden and the dance continues in lindy hop folklore.
te roy williams and his orchestra recorded the song "lindbergh hop," written by ted nixon and elmer snowden, on may 25, 1927.
[7][8] the memphis jug band on 9/13/1928 recorded "lindberg hop- overseas stomp," written by jab jones and will shade.
[9]

often referred to as the "first generation" of lindy hop, dancers such as george snowden, leroy "stretch" jones, twistmouth george and edith matthews inspired many other dancers and troupes (including frankie manning) to take up lindy hop.

twistmouth george and matthews are credited with inventing the "twist" that characterises the first few steps of the follower's footwork in the swingout.

by the end of the classic era lindy hop was danced across harlem in ballrooms, night clubs], cabaret clubs, rent parties, apartments, and street parties â€” almost anywhere people came together with music to dance.
